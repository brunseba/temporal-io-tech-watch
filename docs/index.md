# Temporal.io Enterprise Deployment Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for deploying Temporal.io in enterprise Kubernetes environments. This guide provides everything you need to design, implement, and operate a production-ready Temporal deployment.

## What is Temporal?

Temporal is a distributed, scalable, durable, and highly available orchestration engine that executes asynchronous long-running business logic in a scalable and resilient way. It enables developers to build reliable applications by abstracting away the complexity of distributed systems.

## What You'll Learn

This documentation covers:

- **Architecture Design**: Complete system architecture with security, monitoring, and scalability considerations
- **Implementation**: Step-by-step deployment guides for production environments
- **Operations**: Monitoring, troubleshooting, backup, and disaster recovery procedures
- **Development**: Best practices for building workflows and integrating applications
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security implementation with SSO, TLS, and secrets management
- **GitOps**: Automated deployment strategies using ArgoCD and modern DevOps practices

## Target Audience

This guide is designed for:

- **Developers** building workflows and activities
- **Product Owners** defining business requirements
- **Architects** designing system integration
- **SRE/DevOps Engineers** operating and maintaining infrastructure

## Architecture Overview

Our target architecture includes:

- **Temporal Backend**: Deployed in `temporal-backend` namespace
- **Business Applications**: Deployed in `temporal-product` namespace
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistence and visibility
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for advanced visibility
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + OpenTelemetry
- **Security**: Authentik SSO + HashiCorp Vault + cert-manager
- **GitOps**: ArgoCD for deployment automation
